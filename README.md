# COVID-19 Data Exploration
## Using data from Our World In Data and MYSQL to explore and discover trends.

### Project Overview:
For this project, I conducted an exploratory data analysis using the COVID-19 data set provided by Our World In Data, with the objective of identifying trends and insights.

### Data Processing:
The data set was initially explored using Microsoft Excel, and was then divided into three logical tables, with unnecessary data removed. Following this, the data was cleaned and prepared for loading into a MYSQL Database. 

### Data Exploration:
A variety of queries and commands were used to explore the data further, with the results utilized to create insightful visualizations in Tableau. 
Skills used: 
- Joins
- CTE's 
- Variables 
- Windows Functions
- Aggregate Functions 
- Creating Views

### Key Findings:
- The first quarter of 2022 was the worst quarter for COVID-19, likely due to the emergence of the Omicron variant, with a 266% increase in cases compared to the previous quarter. 
- The United States had the highest number of cumulative deaths at 1,068,214, while Peru had the highest number of deaths per million at 6,454. 
- 64% of the world is fully vaccinated.
- Countries with higher GDP per capita were more severely impacted by the virus, although this could be skewed due to irregular reporting in poorer countries. 
- The overall trend in cases and deaths since the second quarter of 2022 has been downward.


### Tableau:
To aid in the exploration and communication of the findings, I created an interactive Tableau dashboard that provides easy-to-understand and visually appealing representations of the data.
