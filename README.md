# COVID-19 Data Exploration
## Using data from Our World In Data and MYSQL to explore and discover trends.

I downloaded the COVID-19 data set provided by [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) for this project.

### Process:
1. Explored the data using Microsoft Excel.
2. Divided the data into three logical tables and removed unnecessary data.
3. Prepared/Cleaned that data to make it ready to load into MYSQL Database.
4. Used a variety of queries and commands to explore the data further and find insights. [View MYSQL Queries](https://github.com/Scombes/COVID_data_exploration/blob/main/data_exploration.sql)
5. Used query results to create visuals in Tableau.

### Takeaways:
- 2022-Q1 was the worst quarter for COVID-19. This is most likely due to the Omicron variant. There was a 266% change in cases from 2021-Q4 to 2022-Q1.
- The United States has the most deaths per country cumulatively at 1,068,214. In comparison, Peru has the most deaths per million at 6,454.
- 64% of the world is fully vaccinated.
- Countries with higher GDP Per Capita were harder hit by the virus. This could be skewed because poorer countries reporting was irregular.
- The overall trend in cases and deaths since 2022-Q2 has been downward.

### Tableau:
Using the results of the data exploration, I created an interactive dashboard that lets you visually explore the data results.
